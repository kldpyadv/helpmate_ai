Overview of Flask Application Components
This application employs Flask to facilitate a chatbot conversation interface, engaging users in a dialog to provide laptop recommendations. The architecture comprises a main Flask application file (app.py), a utility module (functions.py), and a frontend HTML template (chat.html).

app.py - The Flask Application Core
Purpose: Acts as the gateway for the Flask application, orchestrating routing, session management, and the initiation of chatbot conversations.
Principal Functions:
default_func(): Launches the chat interface, starting a new conversation.
getresponse(): Interprets user inputs to generate and return chatbot replies.
end_conv(): Terminates the ongoing chat session, resetting for a new start.
functions.py - Utility and Logic Module
Purpose: Houses the chatbot's logic, including handling OpenAI API communication, analyzing user inputs, and determining laptop recommendations.
Key Features:
initialize_conversation(): Sets up the chat with an introductory system message about the chatbot's capabilities.
get_chat_model_completions(messages): Fetches responses from the OpenAI API based on the conversation history.
moderation_check(user_input): Ensures user inputs are appropriate before processing.
intent_confirmation_layer(response_assistant): Verifies that the chatbot correctly understands the user's intent.
dictionary_present(response): Derives user requirements from chatbot interactions.
compare_laptops_with_user(user_req_string): Aligns user preferences with available laptops to suggest options.
send_user_email(): Invokes an API to email the user, enhancing engagement.
chat.html - Frontend Interface
Purpose: Offers a graphical interface for users to interact with the chatbot, presented through a web browser.
Essential Components:
Chat Window: Visualizes the exchange between the user and the chatbot.
Input Field: A textbox for user input.
Submit Button: Triggers the processing of the user's message.
JavaScript Functions:
appendUserMessage(message): Inserts the user's message into the chat window.
appendBotMessage(data): Displays the chatbot's reply.
showProcessingIndicator(): Indicates that the chatbot is formulating a response.
removeProcessingIndicator(processingId): Clears the indicator post-response.
clearChatHistory(): Resets the conversation, preparing for a new session.
